Welcome to the *Planetside 2 API Tracker* an unofficial collection of Planetside 2 resources and API issues compiled by the discord community.
This repositories focus is to act as a place for members of the community to share resources that are for or from the Planetside ceneus, and can be found
in the following sub directories.

## Census & Census Patches
Full static census collection copies for versioning. As well as manually crafted census patches, for missing census data.

## Maps
A collection if in-game map lods 0-3 quality. Useful in conjunction with the API for the creation of web maps or overlays.

## Titles
Full tracking of all current titles, how and when they are awarded and if they're still achievable.

## Weapons
Community created sanctions list for all weapons, intended for use in unifying community sites/bots to use a single list for stat calculations.

## Issues
Issues are used for tracking of known census issues, as well as updates to the weapons sanctions.
Labels are split for Rest API, Streaming API, and Features. Found something not on the list? Or request an update to the sanctions? Open an issue or PR to start a discussion.
